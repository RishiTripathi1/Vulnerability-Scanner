# Vulnerability-Scanner
I set up and configure a Windows Virtual Machine, install and utilize a powerful vulnerability scanner and uncover vulnerabilities that hide within the system. I did this project to gain experience with Nessus Essentials and learn how to scan for vulnerabilities and develop effective remediation strategies to mitigate the vulnerabilities and enhance the systems security posture.
## Installation of Windows on Virtual Box
*Download the Windows 10 installation media to get Windows 10 ISO image.<br>
*After the image is locally saved on the computer, start the installation process.
## Preparing VM for scanning
This includes tuning of security updates and installing any existing updates,turning off the firewall and ensuring that virtual machine is on the same network as the machine that will perform the scan.<br>
These steps are crucial to ensure that Nessus can accurately identify any vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the system so we can address them and improve the VM security later.<br>
Can try simple ping test to confirm the VM is on the same network.

## Install and Configure Nessus
Create a new scan and see all the options for scanning.
The scanner offers several scan options to help you assess and improve the security of the network. The basic network scan is a good starting point for understanding the overall security posture of the network. It scans the network to identify open ports,running services and potential vulnerabilities on the
hosts within the network.<br>
### Basic Network Scan
This requires filling out just two required fields.
The name of the scan and the IP address or subnet range you want to target. <br>
Nessus offers the ability to schedule periodic scan,Once your scan is complete, you can receive notification via email. <br>
In the discovery option, you can change the scan type to Common ports,All ports or custom.<br>
The assessment settings in the essentially Essentials scanner allow you to configure how the scanner performs the scan and what types of vulnerabilities it looks for.<br>
In the Report Section we control how the scan results are processed and presented to the user. we have the option to adjust the level of detail to your specific needs and requirements.<br>
In Advanced settings we can control the number of hosts that will be scanned at the same time and the network read timeout.<br>
## Initial Scan
You will see that this status change to running on the right side of the screen and you will be provided
with a nice visualizations of the vulnerabilities detected.
The vulnerabilities are ordered into five different levels based on their importance.
Critical, High, medium, low and info.
This way you can quickly identify the most important vulnerabilities that require immediate attention.<br>

That's how Nessus works.
You give it a target, the IP address or the whole subnet for the network and provide you with all the
vulnerabilities and possible remediation steps.
## Credential Scan
Let's take it to the next step and add credential to our saved windows can to get more detail information.<br>
There are several authentication methods that can be used.
The available authentication methods for Windows credential scanning are password, Kerberos, LM hash and NTLM hash.<br>

If you try to run the scan you will receive a notification that the account used doesn't have the necessary privileges. This is because the Non-default administrator account is an automatically added to the local group administrators
and doesn't have the appropriate rights to access all the system files and settings.<br>
To address this issue, we need to perform a few additional steps.<br>
*Go To Services -> Remote Registery. change the startup type to automatic.
Which will allow you to remotely connect to the system registry database and perform different operations.<br>
*Search for User Account Control, Slide the bar to the bottom to never notify and click on, this will prevent user account control prompts from interrupting our scan.<br>
*Open the Registery Editor, navigate to a specific location where you can create a new DWord value.

This will enable the local account token filter policy, which allows non-administrator accounts to
access administrative resources on the system when using remote procedure call.<br>
### We can also add Vulnerable software to the VM for getting a better scan.<br>

### This new scan has given us a lot more vulnerabilities than the first one because it is able to scan deeper into the VM due to having credentials.<br>
## Remediation of Vulnerabilities
Once you have found all the vulnerabilities and the issues presented to you, it's time to remediate them. First, we need to ensure that our system is receiving the latest security patches. It's also important to remove any potential threats from our system.<br>
Now we can perform a remediation scan to show that the vulnerabilities are fixed.

This is exactly what we were hoping for.
And it means that our system is now secure and protected against potential cyber attacks.
I have learned how to use Nessus to scan and identify vulnerabilities in a system, how to interpret scan results, and how to remediate any issues that were found.
